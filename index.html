<h2>Research activities</h2>
<p>My main research interest is in tracing the clustering of high-redshift galaxies through <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04496">line-intensity mapping</a>.</p>
<p>My primary focus in the past has been on various aspects of the <a href="http://comap.caltech.edu">Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project</a> (COMAP), which aims to measure the CO(1-0) line-intensity power spectrum at redshift 3. In November 2021, the collaboration produced <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=title%3A%22COMAP%20Early%20Science%22&sort=date%20asc%2C%20bibcode%20asc">a series of seven preprints</a> (to be submitted to the Astrophysical Journal) on early science verification with the COMAP Pathfinder; I led <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05931">the fifth paper in the series</a> describing constraints from the Pathfinder upper limit and forecasts for future auto- and cross-spectrum analyses.

Other publications that I have led look at various questions about how to model the COMAP target signal, with topics such as
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03005">contamination from lower-redshift interloper lines</a></li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04550">cross-correlation of COMAP data with galaxy surveys</a></li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00209">exploiting the power spectrum quadrupole to disentangle line intensity, line bias, and shot noise</a></li>
<li>and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11171">anticipating the effect of line widths on the COMAP signal</a>.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>I have also written <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08135">signal and sensitivity forecasts for the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">[C ii]</span> line at high redshift</a> as part of work done for the <a href="https://ccatobservatory.org">CCAT-prime</a> science working group. I continue to be involved in forecasting as CCAT-prime/FYST breaks ground and targets first light in 2023.</p>
<p>Beyond modelling, I recently joined the <a href="https://cosmology.caltech.edu/projects/TIME">TIME</a> collaboration and expect to work on simulation pipeline design and end-to-end analysis pipeline testing.</p>
<p>During my PhD, I was directly involved in commissioning of the COMAP instrument, with tasks including writing the quicklook software, measuring the near-field beam pattern for prototype feeds, and looking for systematics such as standing waves in commissioning data. I also worked on the final stages of lab integration of the <a href="http://www.gb.nrao.edu/argus">Argus</a> receiver on the Green Bank Telescope as part of the instrument team.</p>

<h2>Teaching and service</h2>
<p>I gained significant teaching experience while completing my PhD at Stanford, where I worked as a teaching assistant in three different introductory physics courses. Each time, a key goal was to employ active learning techniques to have students reflect on their problem-solving process and thus gain understanding in ways that they could not with rote methods. I've been lucky enough to work under the supervision of physics education faculty and staff at Stanford who have strong interests in improving undergraduate courses through better teaching methods.</p>
<p>I mentored one undergraduate summer student in 2018, who worked on COMAP gain calibration as well as calibrator assembly and testing.</p>
<hr />
<p>During much of my time at Stanford, I served on the Stanford Physics <a href="https://physics.stanford.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion">Equity and Inclusion Committee</a>, as one of several graduate student representatives. As my first project, I led a redesign of the E&I committee's website to make more information more presentable to those interested. Working with the other student representatives, I also helped start a series of meetings with graduate students beyond the committee to identify action items in line with the E&I committee's strategic plan, with topics ranging from graduate admissions and first-year advising to health care subsidies and department climate.</p>
<p>I have also taken part in numerous education and public outreach events representing the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC), from middle school science fairs to APS expos.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous history, professional and otherwise</h2>
<p>I obtained an AB in Physics (high honours) as part of Princeton's Class of 2014. Most of my independent work was done with the Gravity Group. I did one summer's work on ACTPol bias electronics and one summer plus a junior paper's worth of work on MuSE bolometer characterisation. I completed <a href="http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01bc386j41t">an experimental senior thesis on microwave SQUID multiplexing</a>, supervised by Lyman Page.</p>
<p>My PhD thesis, supervised by Sarah Church, is available <a href="http://purl.stanford.edu/yv096yc6652">here</a>. It largely comprises my first-author publications between 2017 and 2019 but also includes unpublished work on COMAP commissioning.</p>
<p>Beyond research and departmental service, I also served as webmaster for Stanford's <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/gsapp">Graduate Students in Applied Physics and Physics</a> group, and have participated frequently in the Meeting of Astrophysics Students at Stanford (MASS) as well as the KIPAC Statistics and Machine Learning Journal Club.</p>
